Before run this code, you must clone my other repository https://github.com/sandrabl9/apirest and istall the dependencies because it doesnÂ´t have deploy (run in a localhots),

npm run dev -> Server running on port 3001

Now, you can clone https://github.com/sandrabl9/phone-catalog , install the dependencies and run the app (npm start -> Server running on port 3001)

Thanks you so much!!

;D
