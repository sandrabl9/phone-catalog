Before run this code, you must clone my other repository https://github.com/sandrabl9/apirest and install the dependencies because it's deploy in a localhost.

npm run dev -> Server running on port 3001


Now, you can clone https://github.com/sandrabl9/phone-catalog , install the dependencies and run the app 

npm start -> Server running on port 3000

Thank you so much!!
